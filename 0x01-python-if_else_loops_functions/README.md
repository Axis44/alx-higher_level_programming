0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
- program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative
- The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
-The output of the program should be:
     -The number, followed by
                      -if the number is greater than 0: is positive
                      -if the number is 0: is zero
                      -if the number is less than 0: is negative
-followed by a new line


1. The last digit
- program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
-The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
-This line should not change: number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)
-The output of the program should be:
              -The string Last digit of, followed by
              -the number, followed by
              -the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
                                          -if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
                                          -if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
                                          -if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
             -followed by a new line

6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
-program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits
Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
The two digits must be different
01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
Print only the smallest combination of two digits
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
The last number should be followed by a new line
no more than 3 print functions with string format
no more than 2 loops in your code
not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
 not allowed to import any module


7. islower

Prototype: def islower(c):
Returns True if c is lowercase
Returns False otherwise
not allowed to import any module
not allowed to use str.upper() and str.isupper()




8. To uppercase
function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line
